    <p>During the Spring of 2015, I worked with a group of three to create an app that generates recipes based on what ingredients you have available in your kitchen.  The app has a very preliminary login system that allows you to store things in your “pantry” between logins and also has a secondary area where you can add food items that are perishable or not always available.  Using these ingredients and a cooking time that you also input, our program searches the Yummly API and returns to you every recipe in their database that you can make.  We created this program using Python, Flask, and MongoDB.  I worked on both the python back-end of the application, connecting the API functionality, and the basic front-end styling.
