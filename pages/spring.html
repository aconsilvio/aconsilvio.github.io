    <h1>Spring Initiative Web App</h1>
    <div class ="page-sub">
    <div class="page-item">
    <p>During the spring of 2016, I worked with a group of five Olin students to partner with a afterschool program in Mississippi called Spring Initiative, which helps at-risk students improve both academically and socially outside of the classroom.  We worked with the two founders of the program to create a system that allows all program administrators to track the progress of each student on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis to help them understand which aspects of the program are successful and help them obtain quantitative data as they apply for more grants.  My team built this app using Angular, Node.js, Sass, MongoDB, D3.js, and Express.  The app includes two-pronged email authentication, data visualization, and both admin and main user accounts.  The project was done as part of Olin.js, a student-taught class on full-stack web-development at Olin.  See the project on github <a href="https://github.com/davidabrahams/Spring-Initiative" target="blank">here.</a></p>
