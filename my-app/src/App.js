The venture of the multi-year project is a program called Shifting Rhythms, which brings technology, arts, and entrepreneurship curriculum to after school programs throughout the county in a mobile education space.  One of our key values is to work closely with the community so that it is a truly community-driven and wanted project, so we have many partners in the county that we work with as well as three key community partners that advise us on the project.","During my time working on the project, I have been involved in everything from curriculum development and play testing with students, developing and building the mobile education space inside a 7x12 foot trailer, and building relationships with community members and after school organizations throughout the county.  During the Spring of 2018, we are running a pilot version of our curriculum and mobile space that has been developed alongside the community through 450+ interactions with students and many, many interviews and co-designs with community members.",],

The game was based around this act of sharing the Meganâ€™s favorite spoon.", "We created a platform for Meghan and a friend to stand on that had bass-shakers underneath, and when Meghan handed her new friend her spoon, the music would turn on below them.  When music was turned on, Meghan could not only hear it but actually feel the beat, which made her very happy.  The interaction created trust and happiness between Meghan and her new friend, which was exactly our goal for the day.", "Since this project was so short, we ended up using Makey-Makeys instead of Arduinos to create the main experience and Adobe InDesign to create the storybook.

Some of these people had disabilities, some worked in the space and knew it extensively, and their thoughts and commentary have made it into some of my reflections throughout the semester (linked below) as well as the overall design of this website.  I also read a lot during this semester.  Some of the books that stuck with me include Accessibility for Everyone by Laura Kalbag and Design meets Disability by Graham Pullin.", "In terms of the work I did to redesign this website, it started out looking like the image you see above - a bunch of images on a page with no indication that they are links or what content they were going to lead you to.  The colors werenâ€™t accessible and none of the images had alt text.  The site was hard to navigate with a screen reader and was failing most accessibility standards.  This makes sense because I designed it over 2 days with little thought other than 'I need to get all my work up on the internet as soon as possible.'", "Instead, for this website, I thought about the overall structure of the site before I built anything.   I put all relevant information to the user in the sidebar on the left, so they knew exactly what they would get if they clicked on each link in the navigation and gave them an option to move to the next or previous pages at the end of the main content of each page.  I tried to describe pictures as best I could using alt-text, and did my best to use all of the right HTML tags for screen readers.  In some ways, it wasnâ€™t as hard as I thought it would be because I thought about this whole structure from the very beginning - I wasnâ€™t sitting there trying to make an inherently inaccessible website accessible again.  That being said, I gave myself an easy challenge since this website doesnâ€™t require users to input forms or do much beyond view content and click on links. I do however now feel confident that I could build websites that do require these actions in an accessible way.", "I took a lot of inspiration from a plus a - Sara Hendrenâ€™s site about her assistive tech lab, and gov.uk, which are both linked below, while designing this website, but I am aware that there are many many things that can be improved about it.  As any good developer should, I believe in continuous improvement, so here are a few things I know I need to improve about this site.  Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you think there is something to add to the backlog.", "- Thereâ€™s an image on the food source page that contains lots of text - this should be split up into many images with accompanying text to make it better for screen readers.", "- I would like to develop a more interesting way for alt-text to be used or displayed within the site.  Should it show up on hover of the images?  Should it go below the images?  Iâ€™m not sure yet.", "- The top of the page loads in a different place depending on which link you click.  Why does this happen?  Not sure yet, but Iâ€™m going to figure it out.", "- Are the links at the bottom of each content page as accessible as they could be?",],
